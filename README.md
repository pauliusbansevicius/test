## How it Works

The ZVS induction heater is a **self-oscillating parallel resonant inverter**.
ZVS induction heater can be split into two parts: **a parallel resonant circuit** and **a circuit that adds energy to the resonant circuit**


1.  **Power Application**: When the power supply is connected to the ZVS driver, the voltage potential increases on both sides of the resonant circuit and at the gates of the NMOSFETs.
2.  **Asymmetry and Startup**: Because real-world components are not perfect, one NMOSFET will always turn on slightly faster than the other. In the simulation, this is achieved by using slightly different values for resistors **R3** and **R4**. Without this intentional imbalance in a simulation, both NMOSFETs might turn on halfway simultaneously, shorting the power supply and preventing the resonant circuit from oscillating.
3.  **Initial Switching**: Once one NMOSFET turns on—for example, **M2**—it connects the **left** side of the resonant circuit to 0V (ground). At the same moment, **M1** is kept off because its gate is pulled to ground through diode **D3**.
4.  **Initiating Oscillation**: The voltage at the drain of **M1** remains high because **M1** is not connected to ground. This high potential on the **right** side of the resonant circuit initiates the oscillations.
5.  **Resonant Cycle**: The voltage within the resonant circuit begins to rise and then fall. When the voltage on the **right** side of the resonant circuit drops to 0V, the gate of **M2** is pulled to ground through diode **D4**.
6.  **Alternating Cycles**: After **M2** closes, the potential at the gate of **M1** increases until **M1** turns on, which then shorts the **right** side of the resonant circuit to ground. This continuous switching maintains the ZVS oscillations. 
7.  **Efficiency and Heat**: The primary advantage of **Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS)** is that the NMOSFETs are only switched when the voltage across them is at 0V (potential between drain and source is 0V). Theoretically, this makes the circuit nearly 100% efficient. However, in practice, oscillations are not perfect; the NMOSFETs still generate heat and require substantial heatsinks for cooling. Practical efficiency usually ranges between **70-90%**.
8.  **Induction Heating**: The high current flowing through the work coil (**L1**) creates a powerful magnetic field. When a piece of metal is placed inside **L1**, eddy currents are induced within it, which rapidly heat the metal.
